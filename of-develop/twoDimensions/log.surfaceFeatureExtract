Removing all non-manifold edges (edges with > 2 connected faces) unless they cross multiple regions

Initial feature set:
    feature points : 4
    feature edges  : 4
    of which
        region edges   : 4
        external edges : 0
        internal edges : 0


Final feature set:
    points : 4
    of which
        convex             : 0
        concave            : 0
        mixed              : 4
        non-feature        : 0
    edges  : 4
    of which
        external edges     : 0
        internal edges     : 0
        flat edges         : 0
        open edges         : 4
        multiply connected : 0
